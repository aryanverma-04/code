Windows Admin Center gives you full control over all aspects of your server infrastructure and is particularly useful for managing servers on private networks that are not connected to the Internet. Windows Admin Center is the modern evolution of "in-box" management tools, like Server Manager and MMC.

An administrator is someone who can make changes on a computer that will affect other users of the computer. Administrators can change security settings, install software and hardware, access all files on the computer, and make changes to other user accounts.

Using Windows Admin Center in the Azure portal you can manage the Windows Server operating system of your Arc-enabled servers (preview), Azure Stack HCI cluster nodes (preview), and Azure VMs.

You can securely manage your machines from anywhereâ€“without needing a VPN, public IP address, or other inbound connectivity to your machine.

Microsoft's Group Policy Object (GPO) is a collection of Group Policy settings that defines what a system will look like and how it will behave for a defined group of users. Microsoft provides a program snap-in that allows you to use the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).

Examples of group policies include configuring operating system security, adding firewall rules, or managing applications like Microsoft Office or a browser. Group Policies also install software and run startup and login scripts.
