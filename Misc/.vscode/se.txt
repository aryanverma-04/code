SoftEther is an open-source, free-to-use VPN protocol that provides quick
and secure client-to-server and site-to-site communications. Another part of
this software is the VPN bridge that supports the types above of
communication.
The SoftEther project also includes a SoftEther VPN server that allows the
usage of several VPN protocols such as OpenVPN, SSTP, IPSec,
L2TP/IPSec, and SoftEther itself.
In essence, the SoftEther VPN project allows users to connect to a
SoftEther VPN server with or without the SoftEther VPN client software. It
also provides users with the ability to set up their servers. Users can move
from one protocol to another in a few easy steps.

Softether (Software Ethernet) is a project developed at the University of Tsukuba (Japan) by Daiyuu Nobori. It proposes a VPN protocol (Softether or SSL VPN) and the architecture of a VPN server capable of serving multiple VPN protocols (Softether, OpenVPN, SSTP, L2TP/IPSec) simultaneously.

Both the Softether protocol and the Softether server are open-sourced, free, and cross-platform. Softether is presented as an alternative to OpenVPN, and it is considered to be faster.

All the features SoftEther provides strengthen its ability to help users navigate safely and bypass any government firewall, making it a popular VPN (Virtual Private Network) protocol.

Several of the SoftEther important features are listed below:

Available under GNU GPL license;
Uses 256-bit AES encryption;
Supports SSL VPN, OpenVPN, EtherIP, L2TP, L2TPv3, and Microsoftâ€™s SSTP protocols;
Supports IPV6, packet filtering, and dynamic DNS function;
It accepts both TCP and UDP connections;
SoftEther VPN uses RSA certificate authentication and deep inspect packet logging function;
SoftEther VPN client software implements Virtual Network Adapter, and the SoftEther server implements Virtual Ethernet Switch (called Virtual Hub);
It runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, iOS, and Android.

How does SoftEther work?
The SoftEther VPN server is the central piece of the SoftEther architecture. As listed above, it supports a lot of features, and it provides great performance. The most important aspect is the fact that the server supports multiple protocols: VPN over HTTPS (SoftEther), OpenVPN, SSTP, L2TP/IPSec. Thus, you may use a SoftEther server
